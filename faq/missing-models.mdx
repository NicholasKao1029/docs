When you're missing a model, there are 2 "types" of locations that the model can be in

- Models directory
- Direectly in a `custom nodes`

Everything in models directory can be installed into [storage](/storage#installing-models)

Custom nodes can be installed directly into a machine.
You can do this via the docker commands

<DockerCommand/>

E.g. 
```Docker 
RUN wget -P /comfyui/custom_nodes/<dir> <download-link>
```
