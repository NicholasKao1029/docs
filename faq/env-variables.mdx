If a custom node requires a ENV variable, you can do this by adding a docker command to your machine.
For example such as OpenAI key for [this custom node](https://github.com/omar92/ComfyUI-QualityOfLifeSuit_Omar92?tab=readme-ov-file#openai-suite),

<DockerCommand/>

### Steps
1. Edit or create your machine definition.
2. Scroll down to **Extra docker commands** section.
3. Add and modify the command 
```Docker 
ENV VARIABLE_NAME=<value>
```
4. Save your machine definition

This machine will then have `VARIABLE_NAME` as an env variable.
